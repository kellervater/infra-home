There's only [one guide](https://jardazivny.medium.com/the-ultimate-guide-to-yubikey-on-wsl2-part-1-dce2ff8d7e45), which covers many aspects of getting gpg "stuff" running on a smartcard for your OS. It's a bit outdated and covers very specifically the WSL2 part. We wanted to create a refreshed version, where the community can also contribute and place questions. We follow a runbook-like approach of combining some automated scripts with as few manual steps as possible.

This folder contains all necessary manuals and scripts to make the user setup for your Smartcard as convenient as possible.

> [!WARNING]  
> The contents are subject to change, since we've already identified many section which could need some improvement.
